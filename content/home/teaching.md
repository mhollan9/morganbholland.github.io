### Quotes from Students

"Morgan  Holland  is  the  best  instructor  I  have  had  for  an  economics  core  class.  His  lectures  helped  me  understand  the  material,  and  he  really  seems  to  care  about  his  students  and  wants  them  to pass."

"Holland's  availability  and  willingness  to  always  help  his  students  is  what  has  allowed  me  to  better  comprehend  the  material.  He  always  goes  above  and  beyond  to  make  sure  students  are  able  to have  access  to  resources."
